# Assignment3

The python file had been considered as a whole, and I wanted to upload that "one and only" file, but because of the file size and the 25Mb limitaiton of uploading on GitHub, I needed to split it up. So, as it was a pitty to lose the results of my runs, I took some screen shots of the results, provided under the "Screenshots" folder here. Pictures are taken, first, from the results of the 2nd quesiton and then I started with the first question. As a result, the pictures regarding the 3rd part of question 1 can be found in the last pictures.

Three files are provided for question 1: "Part 1", "Part 2", and "Part 3 and Optimizers"
Also for question 2, a python file is uploaded here.
For question 3, I uploaded a Pdf file.

Also, for "Assignment3,Questions1_Part3&Optimizers.ipynb", there is not an error. I, intentionally, interrupted the training process, as I realized I had the screenshots, so there is no need to take the runs again.
